he dataset contains 5172 rows and 3002 columns, with the following observations:

Column Breakdown:

The first column, "Email No.", likely represents email identifiers.
The subsequent columns (e.g., "the", "to", "ect") seem to represent word frequencies or feature counts.
The last column, "Prediction," is possibly a target variable for classification.
Data Types:

Most columns are integers (likely word counts).
One column ("Email No.") is of the object type, which seems to be an identifier.
Next Steps:
Data Cleaning:
Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., "Email No.") if it's not relevant for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of word frequencies.
Summarize the target variable ("Prediction") to understand the class distribution.
Data Visualization:
Create charts to visualize key findings.
Machine Learning (if required):
Use the data for a predictive task (e.g., classifying emails based on "Prediction").

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data by removing unnecessary columns (e.g., "Email No.").
Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Check for class imbalance in the "Prediction" column.
Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Use a machine learning model like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to classify emails.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Save Results:

Provide predictions for a test dataset.
Let me start implementing the code.

Full Code for Email Spam Classification:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Load the dataset
file_path = "emails.csv"  # Update with your local file path
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Step 1: Data Preprocessing
# Dropping the "Email No." column
data_cleaned = data.drop(columns=["Email No."])

# Separating features (X) and target (y)
X = data_cleaned.drop(columns=["Prediction"])
y = data_cleaned["Prediction"]

# Reducing the dataset size by sampling
data_sampled = data.sample(frac=0.2, random_state=42)
X_sampled = data_sampled.drop(columns=["Email No.", "Prediction"])
y_sampled = data_sampled["Prediction"]

# Reducing features by selecting top 100 columns with the highest variance
variances = X_sampled.var(axis=0)
top_features = variances.nlargest(100).index
X_reduced_sampled = X_sampled[top_features]

# Step 2: Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_reduced_sampled, y_sampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y_sampled
)

# Step 3: Model Training - Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Model Evaluation
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Output results
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("\nClassification Report:\n", report)
print("\nConfusion Matrix:\n", conf_matrix)
Instructions:
Save the code above in a .py file (e.g., spam_classification.py).
Ensure the emails.csv file is in the same directory or provide the full path to it in file_path.
Install the necessary libraries if you havenâ€™t already:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Run the script using:
bash
Copy code
python spam_classification.py
